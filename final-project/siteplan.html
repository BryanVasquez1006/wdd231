    <main>
        <p><strong>Site Name:</strong>Mr.Barberman</p>
        <p><strong>Site Name choice reason:</strong>Mr.Barberman tries to fuse both the purpose of the website (have the users be able to get in touch with a barbershop to get its services) and the different services the barbeshop will provide (gaming rooms that are mostly attractive to men while they're waiting for the next available barber)</p>

        <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
        <p>This website will intend to have the users be able to book appointments so they can get an haircut. They will also be able to decide what barber they'd like to get a haircut with. The barbershop will also provide a convenient way to wait  for the next available barber by having the chance to play in the arcade arean and with the most up to date videgame consoles.</p>

        <h2>Scenarios:</h2>
        <p>How can I set up an appointment with an specific barber?</p>
        <p>What services do your barbershop offer that are different from other barbershops?</p>
        <p>How can I apply to get to work with the barbershop?</p>
        <p>how can I know when there are available spots without going at the site?</p>
